There are many possible permutations on this kind of game. I’ll outline one possible concept here:
    A word is presented in the middle of the screen
    The user must type out the word letter by letter
    On correctly typing a letter, the relevant letter in the UI should illuminate in some way
    On incorrect input; the remaining time should be decremented by 3 seconds or something similar
    The user would have 1 minute to enter in as many full words as possible



Primarily, you’ll need to react to user input. This forms the basis of this game.
Not only correct inputs, 
so when the user enters the expected letter correctly,
 but also incorrect inputs — 
 so when the user enters any letter other than the next letter in the word.

Outside of this, you’ll need a dictionary of words
(whereby one is selected at random for each turn of the game).

You’ll need to compare the user’s input with the displayed word,
and then consequently handle the UI updates based on a correct or incorrect keystroke.

Alongside that, you’ll need to be actually timing the game. More specifically, 
you’ll need to terminate the game after 1 minute,
making sure you’ve kept count of the number of correct words entered.
